# Clean output template

This feature has been around for a while but was updated recently.

Sometimes, other agencies or teams in MM will request the built zips of ads built with our framework, with the intention of adjusting them later, or creating extra versions, or translations.

In this case, it’s useful to utilize the ‘clean output’ template, which you can get here:
