# How to create an issue

Issues can be created in a variety of ways, so you can choose the most convenient method for your workflow. Please follow the [GitHub official docs](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) to create a ticket.

:::tip Rules
1. **Create** an issue in the relevant repository.
2. **Be clear** in the request (it will be useful in the future for a pull request).
3. **Assign** the ticket to people in the team.
4. **Insist** if there is no answer in the ticket, the idea is that it be collaborative.
